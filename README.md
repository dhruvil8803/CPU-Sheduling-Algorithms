# Operating System CPU-Sheduling-Algorithms
In this code I have written code for 4 CPU sheduling algorithms in java and the algorithms are:
1) FCFS(First Come First Serve)
2) SJF(Shortest job first)
3) SRTF(Shortest remaining time first)
4) RR(round robin)

This code take the input from .txt file and print Gantt Chart and all calculations related to algorithms.
